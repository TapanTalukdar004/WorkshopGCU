     <p><h3>ICC T20 World Cup 2022: Who Will Win The T20 World Cup 2022</h3>
        <br>
        <img src="cr.jpeg" alt="image error" width="600"> <br> 
        <br>
        The 8th edition of the ICC Men’s T20 world cup 2022 is scheduled to be played in Australia <br>
        from Oct 16-Nov 13. A total of 16 teams will fight it out for the title. The top 8 teams <br>
        from the previous edition have already qualified. The other four teams- Namibia, Scotland,<br>
         Sri Lanka, and West Indies have made it through the previous tournament <br>
         <br>
         Four more teams, Ireland, UAE, Zimbabwe, and the Netherlands have recently qualified for <br>
         the tournament from the ICC T20 World cup group qualifier round. <br>
         <br>
         According to the fixtures of the ICC T20 World Cup 2022, the top 8 teams plus 4 qualifiers have been divided into 2 groups. These are: <br><br>
         <b>Group A: England, New Zealand, Australia, Afghanistan, Sri Lanka & Netherlands</b> <br>
         <b>Group B: India, Pakistan, South Africa, Bangladesh, Ireland & Zimbabwe</b>
        </p> 

        <h2>Team INDIA</h2>
        <p>Team India had a season to forget the last edition. After suffering a thumping defeat against <br>
            arch-rivals Pakistan in their first match, followed by another loss from New Zealand, the <br>
            men in blue could not proceed to the knockout stage. However, India will surely be one of the <br> 
            favorites to win the title. With a new captain Rohit Sharma, the team looks settled. <br>
            <br>
            <img src="india-xi-wc-getty_1663172178897_1663172201882_1663172201882.webp" alt="image error" width="700" ><br><br>
            Virat Kohli can play fearless cricket, given the fact that he has relinquished the captaincy. <br>
            India has all the firepower to dismantle any opposition. If they can hold their nerves and play <br>
            their perfect game in the park, they will be one of the teams to watch out for in the <br>
            ICC Men’s T20 world cup 2022. <br>
            <br>
            In fact, many bookmakers have come out with very favorable odds for India to win the T20 World Cup <br>
            this year. As one of the top contenders for the trophy on most online cricket betting sites, India <br>
            has the outright odds of 4.30 at winning the World Cup, only behind Australia with odds of 4.0. <br>
            <br>
        </p><br>
        <h2>PAKISTAN</h2>
        <p>Pakistan had a memorable outing in the recently concluded ICC Men’s T20 world cup 2021. The side led by <br>
            Babar Azam showed the world what they are capable of. In fact, Pakistan was the only team that never <br>
            lost any game in the league stage, winning 5 matches on the trot. But, they lost at the hands of Australia <br>
            in the semi-final match, perishing all the hopes of their fans. <br>
            <br>
            <img src="pakistan-cricket-team-sydney-ap-16674796784x3.avif" alt="image error" width="700"><br><br>
            Their batting order has shown immense discipline with Babar Azam, Mohammad Rizwan, Shadab Khan, etc. They have <br>
            one of the best pace attacks with Shaheen Shah Afridi, Md Wasim, etc, firing from all cylinders. The teams would <br>
            ill afford to take Pakistan lightly this edition. <br>
        </p><br>
        <h2>AUSTRALIA</h2>
        <p>The defending champions of ICC T20 World cup 2021, Australia, will start as the favorites to win the <br>
            ICC Men’s T20 world cup 2022. The side under the leadership of Aaron Finch proved why they are the best. <br>
            <br>
            They have one of the best batting lineups with Cameroon Green, Finch, Maxwell, Wade, Stoinis, etc. Australia’s bowling <br>
            attack, especially the pace bowlers, can dismantle the bowling attack of any opponent. <br><br>
            <img src="aus.jpeg" alt="" width="700"><br>
            <br>
            The biggest advantage for them will be that the tournament will be played in their backyard, where Australia has always dominated. <br>
        </p><br>
        <h2>ENGLAND</h2>
        <P>The fourth team with a high chance of winning the ICC Men’s T20 world cup 2022 is England. Eoin Morgan-led team dominated for most <br>
            of the last edition, but they failed to defeat New Zealand in the semi-final. If we talk of the most dangerous team on paper, <br>
            it’s mighty England. <br>
